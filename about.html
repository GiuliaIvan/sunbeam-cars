                        <p class="about-p"> The company SunbeamCars Inc. was established more than 30 years ago 
                            by the couple Lisa and Peter, who together are responsible for the day-to-
                            day operations.<br>
                            The company rents out cars and among their customers you will find busi-
                            ness people, tourists and people who need to rent a car because they do 
                            not have one. The customers are often regular customers who know the 
                            company well, and Lisa and Peter knows many of the them very well.<br>
                                The company is located at a transport hub, from where buses and trains 
                            arrive and depart regularly. Customers must both pick up and drop off the 
                            rented car at the company's office, which is located next to the garage, 
                            where the cars are parked and where they are also cleaned so that they can
                            be rented out again.<br>
                                The company has 25 cars which are categorized according to number of 
                            people, luggage capacity and comfort. There are 3 categories: Budget (4 
                            persons, 1 large bag, low comfort), Middle class (5 persons, 3 suitcases, 
                            medium comfort), and Minivan (7 persons, 4 suitcases, high comfort).<br>
                                Reservations for cars can only be made by telephone. On the company's 
                            website you can read about Lisa and Peter and see examples of rental cars 
                            and prices. Central to the website is the company's contact information.<br>
                                The couple's two daughters and their sons-in-law help out when things are
                            busy.
